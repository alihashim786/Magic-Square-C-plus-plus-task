# Magic Square Solver Using 2D Pointers

This program solves a magic square using 2-D pointers. It prompts the user for the dimension of the magic square and solves it for the given dimension. Proper memory allocation and deallocation are handled within the code. For more details, please refer to the attached `magic-square.pdf` file.

## What is a Magic Square?

A **magic square** is a square grid filled with distinct integers where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and both diagonals are the same.

For example, a 3x3 normal magic square is an arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., nÂ² in such a way that the sum of each row, column, and both diagonals is equal.

### Example of a 3x3 Magic Square:

    6 1 8
    7 5 3
    2 9 4

In this example, the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is 15.

## Algorithm Used: Loubere's Algorithm

To construct the magic square, we use **Loubere's algorithm**. The details of this algorithm are described in the `magic-square.pdf` file.

### Program Features:
- Asks the user for the dimension of the magic square.
- Solves the magic square for the given dimension.
- Handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.

For a more detailed explanation of the algorithm and implementation, please refer to the attached `magic-square.pdf`.
